Theme: Potomac

NOTE: The Potomac theme for Watershed Now! is based upon the "Misty Look" theme,
ported to Drupal from WordPress by Chainarin Thanichaiyawat (http://kiterminal.com)

Potomac was forked from Misty Look so that the regions and block placement would work with
Watershed Now!'s context configuration.
