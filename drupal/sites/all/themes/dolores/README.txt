Watershed "Child" Themes

The Watershed theme should not be used on it's own, but rather as the parent theme of one or more child themes that ship with it, or are created by other designers/developers. You cannot use any of these child themes w/o installing the parent Watershed theme, as child theme inherit code, layout, stylesheets, etc., from the parent theme.

- To learn more about the Watershed theme, see its README.txt.
