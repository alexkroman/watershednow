Based upon the Simple Payments module, Simple Donations creates a simple PayPal donation form that can be added to node page (and teaser) displays of specified content types.

Requires Simple Payments and its associated Simple Payments PayPal module.

== Usage ==

* Make sure that your PayPal settings are correctly configured for Simple Payments module.
* Enable simple donations for those content types for which you would like to add a donation link,
  this is done on the content type settings form (the same form where you set the title field, body, etc.)
* Optionally, you can configure this module to display the donations form on node teasers, as well as full-page node views.
